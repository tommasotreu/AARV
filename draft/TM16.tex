% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

\subsection{A brief history of time delay cosmography}
\label{sec:history}

Once upon a time, there was an important article written by \citet{Ref64}.

Early attempts. Systematic errors evident.

B1608: HST data on Einstein Ring, fully modeled, precision cosmology.

% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

\subsection{Current context}
\label{sec:context}

Towards accurate cosmology with multiple probes.

Time delays lie between local Hubble constant measurement and other
kinematic probes at intermediate redshift (BAO, SNe).

Requirements of each probe: sufficient precision to test
systematics of the others.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Theoretical background}
\label{sec:theory}

Gravitational lensing. Time delay surface. Distance.

Notes on lens mass distribution.

Notes on weak lensing effects.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Time delay distance measurement}
\label{sec:overview}

Outline key analysis steps.

Next three sections will each describe current state of the art,
current limitations, and principal sources of systematic error
of the three key parts of the problem.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Measuring time delays}
\label{sec:timedelay}

Preamble.

% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

\subsection{Monitoring Observations}

State of the art: COSMOGRAIL optical monitoring.

Limitations: scheduling.

Systematic errors: uniform calibration and photometry.

% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

\subsection{Lightcurve Analysis}

State of the art: TDC results.

Systematic errors: microlensing, correlated noise.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Modeling the lens mass distribution}
\label{sec:lensmodel}

Preamble.

% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

\subsection{High Resolution Imaging Observations}

State of the art: HST, Keck AO.

Limitations: resolution, bright quasar images.


% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

\subsection{Lens Modeling}

State of the art: pixelated source reconstruction,
simply-parameterised lens mass distributions, MCMC.

Limitations: skilled labor.

Systematic errors: source pixelation/regularisation, lens model
assumptions.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Lens environments and line of sight effects}
\label{sec:los}

State of the art: ray-traced cosmological simulations, matched via
number counts.

Limitations/systematics: incomplete model: local vs line of sight
mass,  ignoring multi-plane lensing, external convergence only.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{From time delay distances to cosmography}
\label{sec:cosmo}

Approach: combining CMB and time delay distances. Blinding.

Results. Internal consistency. Consistency with other probes.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Outlook}
\label{sec:cosmo}

Preamble.

% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

\subsection{Precision}

Sample size. Stage 3, stage 4 surveys. Monitoring solutions.

Extrapolations to N lenses assuming X\% precision per time delay
distance, forecasts.

% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

\subsection{Accuracy}

Addressing systematics associated with time delay measurement, lens
modeling, environment characterisation.

Accuracy in joint analysis: hierarchical inference.
