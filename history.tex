\citet{Ref64} first suggested that strong lens time delays could be
used to measure absolute, cosmological distances, and
therefore the Hubble Constant to leading order. Unfortunately, no
strong lensing systems were known at that time, and therefore his
intuition remained purely theoretical for over a decade.

The prospects of using time delays for cosmography suddenly brightened
in the late seventies, with the discovery of the first strongly lensed
quasar \citep{WCW79}. Even though they were not the strongly lensed
supernovae that Refsdal had had in mind, quasar fluxes are sufficiently
variable \citep{Van82} that people were able to start to put Refsdal's
idea in practice \citep{Van89}.
The first multiply imaged supernova was discovered in 2014,
fifty years afer Refsdal's initial suggestion \citep{Kel++15}, lensed
by a foreground cluster of galaxies. The time delays are being
measured at the time of writing
\citep{Rod++16,Kel++16}; however, it is unclear at the moment whether the
cluster potential can be constrained with sufficient accuracy to yield
interesting cosmological information \citep{Tre++16}. In general, we
expect the more straightforwardly-modeled, more numerous galaxy-scale
time delay lenses to be the most useful systems for cosmography, with
supernovae competing for attention with quasars \citep{O+M10}.

In this review, we will restrict our case to the hitherto much more
common and better understood case of variable active galactic nuclei
(AGN) being lensed by foreground elliptical galaxies.

Discovery and monitoring of lensed quasars continued in the eighties and
nineties, powered by heroic efforts. By the end of the millennium the
number of known strongly lensed systems was in double digits
\citep{CSS02}, and the first truly robust time delays were measured
\citep{Kun++97,Sch++97}.
The industrial detection of multiply imaged AGN finally took off at the
beginning of the current millennium, with the improvement of panoramic
search technology in dedicated or existing surveys
\citep{Bro++03,Oguri:2006p5865,Agn++15}.

The initial period of time delay cosmography was marred by controversies over
systematic errors.  The measurement of time delays was particularly
controversial during the nineties as the quality of the early data
allowed for multiple estimated values \citep{PRH92}, owing to the combined
effects of gaps in the data, and microlensing noise in the optical
light curves. This problem was solved definitively at the turn of the
millennium, with the beginning of modern monitoring campaigns,
characterized by high cadence, high precision, and long duration, both
at optical and radio wavelengths
\citep{Fas++99,Fas++02,Bur++02,Hjo++02,Jak++05,Eig++05}, as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:oldvsmoderndt}. We discuss
modern monitoring campaigns in more detail in Section~\ref{ssec:timedelay}.

Finally, when robust time delays started to become available, the
focus of the controversy shifted to the modeling of the gravitational
potential of the lens. Typically, in the mid nineties, the only
constraints available to modelers were the quasar image positions,
time delays, and to lesser extent flux ratios (limited by
microlensing, variability and differential extinction). Thus, the best
one could do was to assume some simple form for the lens mass
distribution, such as a singular isothermal sphere \citep{K+F99},
% thus breaking the mass sheet degeneracy,
and to neglect the
effects of structure along the line of sight. As a result of these necessary
but oversimplistic assumptions, the apparent random errors grossly underestimated
the total uncertainty, leading to measurements that were apparently
significantly inconsistent
between groups, or with those from other techniques
\citep{K+S04}. Since then, two methods have been pursued in order to
% break degeneracies in more flexible modeling of the lensing data and
obtain realistic estimates of the uncertainties. One consists of using
large samples of systems with relatively weak priors
\citep{Ogu07b}. The other method consists of obtaining high quality data for
each lens system, including improved astrometry \citep{Cou++97}, detailed imaging of
the quasar host galaxy
\citep{Keeton:2000p241,KKM01,Koo++03,WBB04,Suy++06}, or non-lensing data like the deflector
stellar velocity dispersion \citep{T+K02b} and the properties of
galaxies along the line of sight \citep{K+Z04,Suy++10}. We discuss
these approaches in Section~\ref{ssec:lensmodel}. The astounding
improvement in data quality over the past two decades is illustrated
in Figure~\ref{fig:oldvsmodernimage}.

providing thousands of constraints on the deflection angle, and thus on
the derivatives of the gravitational potential.

Ultimately, the controversies over systematic errors were essential to
spur the community to overcome the difficulties and find ways to
address them. This is a natural and probably inevitable part of the
scientific process. However, the bitterness of some of those
controversies during the ninenties and early noughties still resonates
today: unfortunately, some of the scientists that followed the field
with excitement at that time are still under the impression that
strong lensing time delays are inherently inaccurate and imprecise. As
we have briefly described here, and we will show in detail in the
next sections, in the last twenty years the field has moved forward
considerably implementing many solutions to the lessons learned the
hard way.
