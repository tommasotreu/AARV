Dear X,

in the past several months we have been writing a review entitled
"Time delay cosmography", invited by Eiichiro Komatsu, to appear in
Astronomy and Astrophysics Review. We plan to post the draft review on
arxiv on May 6, in order to gather feedback from the broad community,
and then submit to the journal by the deadline May 15.

We thought you might be interested in reading the current draft and we
would be most grateful if you could give us any comments or feedback
you might have before May 5, so that we can correct any errors or
omissions before posting on arxiv. We have included a lot of
references, but we would not be suprised if we have missed some
important contribution. We apologize in advance for any oversight, and
we would be grateful if you could point it out.

The current draft is available on a public github repository

https://github.com/tommasotreu/AARV/blob/master/README.md

Please feel free to download it, read it and give us your feedback, by
writing us an issue in github, or via e-mail to both of us. The first
method is preferred as it allows us to keep track of things and it
allows reader to see what has already been flagged.

Thank you in advance for your help. Best wishes,

Tommaso & Phil
