\begin{abstract}

Gravitational time delays, observed in strong lens systems where the
variable background source is multiply-imaged by a massive galaxy in
the foreground, provide direct measurements of cosmological distance
that are very complementary to other cosmographic probes. The success
of the technique depends on the availability and size of a suitable
sample of lensed quasars or supernovae, precise measurements of the
time delays, accurate modeling of the gravitational potential of the
main deflector, and our ability to characterize the distribution of
mass along the line of sight to the source. We review the progress
made during the last 15 years, during which the first competitive
cosmological inferences with time delays were made, and look ahead to
the potential of significantly larger lens samples in the near future.
