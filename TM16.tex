\begin{abstract}

Gravitational time delays, observed in strong lens systems where the
variable background source is multiply-imaged by a  massive galaxy in
the foreground, provide direct measurements of cosmological distance
that are very complementary to other cosmographic probes. The success of
the technique depends on the availability and size of a suitable sample
of lensed quasars or supernovae, precise measurements of the time
delays, accurate modeling of the lens mass distributions, and our
ability to characterize the density environment along the line of sight
to the source. We review the progress made during the last 15 years,
during which the first competitive cosmological inferences with time
delays were made, and look ahead to the potential of significantly
larger lens samples in the near future.

% TT: Mention blindness? PJM: I'm not sure it belongs here - it's not unique to time delays, and abstracts of reviews shoudl be especially short...
