% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

What is time delay cosmography? Why is it cool? What is it good for?
What are the challenges? 

Blindness: with high precision comes greater
responsibility. Extraordinary claims etc.

%\subsection{Current context}
%\label{sec:context}

%Towards accurate cosmology with multiple probes.

%Time delays lie between local Hubble constant measurement and other
%kinematic probes at intermediate redshift (BAO, SNe).

%Requirements of each probe: sufficient precision to test
%systematics of the others.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Theoretical background [PJM]}
\label{sec:theory}

%Gravitational lensing. Time delay surface. Distance.

%Notes on lens mass distribution.

%Notes on weak lensing effects.

Lensing, Fermat's principle and potential.

FIGURE: SCHEMATIC WAVEFRONT DIAGRAM FROM T\&E15. 

Time delay distance. 

Importance of mass distribution in lens.

Model (mass-sheet) degeneracy and its generalizations

Importance of mass along the line sight - the universe is not Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker.

\section{Modern Time delay distance measurement 2010+ [PJM]}
\label{sec:timedelay}

%Outline key analysis steps.

%Next three sections will each describe current state of the art,
%current limitations, and principal sources of systematic error
%of the three key parts of the problem.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Measuring time delays [PJM]}
label{ssec:tdmeasurements}

%Preamble.

Mention importance of blindness in all measurements. 


% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

\subsubsection{Monitoring Observations}

%State of the art: COSMOGRAIL optical monitoring.

%Limitations: scheduling.

%Systematic errors: uniform calibration and photometry.

\subsubsection{Lightcurve Analysis}

%State of the art: TDC results.

%Systematic errors: microlensing, correlated noise.

\subsection{Modeling the lens mass distribution [TT]}
\label{sec:lensmodel}

%Preamble.

% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

\subsubsection{High Resolution Imaging Observations}

%State of the art: HST, Keck AO.

%Limitations: resolution, bright quasar images.


% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

\subsubsection{Lens Modeling Techniques}

%State of the art: pixelated source reconstruction,
%simply-parameterised lens mass distributions, MCMC.

%Limitations: skilled labor.

%Systematic errors: source pixelation/regularisation, lens model
%assumptions.

\subsubsection{The Role of Stellar kinematics}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Lens environments and line of sight effects [PJM]}
\label{sec:los}

%State of the art: ray-traced cosmological simulations, matched via
%number counts.

%Limitations/systematics: incomplete model: local vs line of sight
%mass,  ignoring multi-plane lensing, external convergence only.

\section{From time delay distances to cosmography [PJM]}
\label{sec:cosmo}

%Approach: combining CMB and time delay distances. Blinding.

%Results. Internal consistency. Consistency with other probes.

\subsection{Precision [PJM}

FIGURE: Forecasts for 10,50,100,1000 lenses for various cosmological models (w, wa+w0, curvature etc etc). CosmoSIS forecasts (ackn. Dave \& Elise, ask them). 

Check Jee et al.

%Sample size. Stage 3, stage 4 surveys. Monitoring solutions.

%Extrapolations to N lenses assuming X\% precision per time delay
%distance, forecasts.

\subsection{Accuracy [PJM]}

%Addressing systematics associated with time delay measurement, lens
%modeling, environment characterisation.

%Accuracy in joint analysis: hierarchical inference.

Discussion of systematic uncertainties

Time delay measurement. Light curve quality. 

Lens mass modeling. Percent-level systematics due to model assumptions (ie MSD). IFU observations, resolved stellar kinematics. Ensembles. 

Environment and line of sight

Time delay perturbations (someone's noise is somebody else's signal..)

The importance of blinding.

\subsection{Cosmic complementarity [TT]}

What's the point? Arent' other probes already doing it? Our place in the cosmology ecosystem. Discuss place relative to other distance indicators like Cepheids, BAO, Sne. Then complementarity with growth of structure probes like weak lensing, clusters etc etc. How important is H0?

Importance of multiple INDEPENDENT measurements for discovery of new physics.
