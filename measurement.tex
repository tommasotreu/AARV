Since 2010, it has been recognized that accurate cosmography with
individual lens systems involves the following key analysis steps.

\begin{description}
    \item{\bf Time Delay Estimation} The light curve extracted from
    monitoring observations is used as input to an inference of the
    time delay between the multiple images.
    \item{\bf Lens Modeling} High resolution imaging data are used to
    constrain a model for the lens mass distribution, which can be used
    to predict Fermat potential differences.
    \item{\bf Environment and Line of Sight Modeling} Additional observational
    information about the field of view around the lens system is used
    to account for the weak lensing effects due to massive structures in
    the lens plane and along the line of sight.
\end{description}

Cosmological parameter inference can then proceed -- although in
practice the  separation between this final step and the ones above is
not clean. Practitioners aspire to a joint inference of lens, source,
environment and cosmological parameters from all the data
simultaneously, but have to date broken the problem down  into the above
steps. In the next three sections we describe current state of the art,
limitations, and principal sources of systematic error of theses three
key measurement parts of the problem.

MEASUREMENTS'' -- BUT DO WE REALLY MEAN THIS?]
