The analysis of B1608$+$656 by \citet{Suy++10} explicitly took into
account the weak lensing effects of external structures.  Such a
correction had been suggested by \citet{Fas++06b}, who identified 4
galaxy groups along the line of sight in a spectroscopic survey of the
B1608$+$656 field, and estimated that they could, if left unaccounted
for, bias any inferred Hubble constant high by around 5\%. Exactly how
to  model this effect has been the topic of a number of papers since
2010: the problem is  how to incorporate our knowledge of where the
galaxies are along the line of sight without introducing additional
bias due to the necessary assumptions about how their (dark) mass is
distributed, and how the rest of the mass budget in the field adds up.

\citet{Suy++10} attempted to solve these problems by comparing the
B1608$+$656 field with a large number of fields with similar  galaxy
number overdensity drawn from the Millenium Simulation, modeling the
line of sight effects with a single external convergence parameter and
accepting a somewhat broad prior distribution for it, in return for not
having to make  strong assumptions about the structure of the galaxy
groups in the field. The external convergence in the simulated fields
was calculated by ray-tracing by \citet{Hil++09}, and the
comparison in galaxy overdensity was enabled by the analysis of galaxy
number counts in archival HST images by \citet{FKW11}, who found that
the B1608$+$656 field was overdense by a factor of two. The resulting
prior PDF for the $\kappa_{\rm ext}$ parameter had median $0.10$ with
the 68\% credible interval spanning 0.05 to 0.18.
