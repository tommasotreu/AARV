What's the point? Arent' other probes already doing it? Our place in the
cosmology ecosystem. Refer back to current constraints from \citet{Suy++13} in
Section~\ref{sec:cospars}, which show other probes.
Discuss place relative to other distance indicators
like Cepheids, BAO, Sne. Linder SL + SNe plots.

Then complementarity with growth of structure
probes like weak lensing, clusters etc etc. How important is H0?

\subsection{Precision [PJM]}

With considerable observational and data analysis effort, the
feasibility  of reaching a precision  of 6-7\% in time delay distance
per lens has been demonstrated. The contributions to this error budget
from  the time delay measurement, mass model, and environment correction
are at present approximately equal and somewhat larger than the
estimated systematic errors. In this situation it makes sense to enlarge
the sample of lenses, in order to beat down the statistical
uncertainties. We return to the question of how to reduce the  residual
systematic errors in the next section.

\citet{C+M09b} made initial Fisher matrix forecasts of the likely
available precision on $H_0$ in large future surveys. They considered
several possible samples, concluding that 100 well-measured systems
(with 5\% distance precision each) should provide sub-percent precision
on the Hubble constant, and provide  dark energy parameter constraints
that are competitive with optimistic forecasts of other ``Stage IV''
cosmological probes. They also note that comparable constraints could be
available from a sample of 4000 time delay lens systems, each with only
photometric redshifts and simple image configuration model constraints
\citep[following][]{Ogu07b}.  Continued investigation of both samples
seems warranted, keeping in mind that the size of such a photometric
sample would be set by the availability of time delays measured at the
$\pm 2$~day level.

What will it take to reach 5\% distance precision in each of 100 lenses?
If \citet{LiaoEtal2015} are right, this sized sample of lenses with
precise time delays should be able to be constructed from analysis of
the LSST light curves. The lens models for these systems should be able
to be constrained to sufficient precision using high resolution imaging
from next generation AO facilities, giant segmented mirror telescopes,
JWST and even WFIRST \citep{Men++15}. High overall mass model precision
will require good spectroscopic data as well: integral field units on
these same telescopes should be able to provide this. The contribution
to the distance uncertainty from the line of sight was particularly high
in the  cases of B1608 and RXJ1131: in most other systems in a large
sample the effects of the environment should be lesser, and they should
(effectively) average down \citep{Col++13}. The main challenge in
reaching the required Stage IV is likely to be the analysis cost: lens
modeling is something of a craft, and scaling up to large samples could
pose problems. Distributing the work among a large team of modelers will
be needed, an approach that is proving effective in the Frontier Fields
cluster lensing project \citep{FF}.

Note on approximation of forecasting using just Ddt,
and not DA as well: above plot is conservative.

\subsection{Accuracy [PJM]}

Discussion of systematic uncertainties:

1) Time delay measurement. Light curve quality.

2) Lens mass modeling. Percent-level systematics due to model
assumptions (ie MSD). IFU observations, resolved stellar kinematics.
Ensembles.

3) Environment and line of sight

Other things: time delay perturbations (someone's noise is somebody else's signal..)
The importance of blinding.
