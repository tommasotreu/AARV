A&ARv: Time Delay CosmographyReview planTommaso Treu & Phil MarshallDeadline: May 15th, 2016Page limit: 30-40 pages (including figures, tables and references), one full page of text being equivalent to 550 words.To do:? Start (public) repository [done]? Start latex file, including correct style[done]? Sketch section content [done]? Decide timeline: February 29 forecast figures. March 15 first draft of our assigned sections. Complete draft April 15, PDF advertized to friends. Meet at 1:30pm every other Friday.? Paste this plan into latex file [TT]? Make milestones [PJM, done]? Issue writing tasks [PJM, done]Abstract [PJM]Include blindness1 Introduction [TT]What is time delay cosmography? Why is it cool? What is it good for? What are the challenges? Blindness: with high precision comes greater responsibility. Extraordinary claims etc.FIGURE: CARTOON OF LENSING, FROM SPACE WARPS WEBSITE?

CosmoSIS forecasts (ackn. Dave & Elise, ask them). 6.2 Accuracy [PJM]Discussion of systematic uncertaintiesTime delay measurement. Light curve quality. Lens mass modeling. Percent-level systematics due to model assumptions (ie MSD). IFU observations, resolved stellar kinematics. Ensembles. Environment and line of sightTime delay perturbations (someone’s noise is somebody else’s signal..)The importance of blinding6.3 Cosmic complementarity [TT]What’s the point of doing this? Aren’t other probes already doing it? Our place in the cosmology ecosystem. Discuss place relative to other distance indicators like Cepheids, BAO, SNe. Then, complementarity with growth of structure probes like weak lensing, clusters, etc etc How important is H0?Importance of multiple INDEPENDENT measurements for discovery of new physics.7 Summary [TT]REFERENCES.
