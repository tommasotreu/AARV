\caption{Schematic diagram, adapted from \citep{TreuAndEllis2015},
illustrating the origin of the gravitational time delay. The small
magnitude of the fractional  time delay (typically $\sim10$~days out of
$10^{12}$ days light travel time) is commensurate with the square of the
deflection angle (typically $\sim1$~arcsecond, or $\sim5\times10^{-6}$
radians).}

lens cosmography. Structures both within and outside the main lens
plane provide weak deflections to the light rays, affecting both the
image positions and time delays.} \label{fig:lineofsightcartoon}
